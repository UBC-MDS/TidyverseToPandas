# tidyversetopandas

## Bringing the Power of tidyverse to Pandas!
**tidyversetopandas** is a Python package designed for users familiar with R's tidyverse who are transitioning to Python. It bridges the syntax gap between R and Python by offering pandas equivalents to popular tidyverse functions. This package is particularly beneficial for data scientists and analysts who seek to leverage pandas' robust capabilities with the familiar syntax of tidyverse.

#### Key Functions:
- `mutate():` Similar to its tidyverse counterpart, this function allows for the creation of new columns or modification of existing ones in a DataFrame.
- `filter():` Enables row-wise filtering, making it easier to sift through DataFrame based on specified conditions.
- `select():` Facilitates the selection of specific columns in a DataFrame, streamlining data manipulation and analysis.
- `arrange():` Offers sorting capabilities for DataFrame based on one or multiple columns.

#### Fitting into the Python Ecosystem
While pandas is a powerful tool for data manipulation in Python, it can be challenging for those accustomed to R's tidyverse syntax. `tidyversetopandas` is unique in its approach to blend these two worlds. In the Python ecosystem, `tidyversetopandas` fits alongside packages that aim to incorporate tidyverse-like functionality into Python's data manipulation landscape, predominantly with pandas. The goal is to make pandas more accessible to those accustomed to tidyverse syntax.Two notable packages in this domain are [tidypandas](https://github.com/tidypyverse/tidypandas) and [siuba](https://github.com/machow/siuba). Both of them represent, similar to `tidyversetopandas`, efforts to bridge the gap between R's tidyverse approach and Python's pandas library, offering users familiar with R's data manipulation tools a more comfortable transition to Python's data science ecosystem. 

There are different syntaxes for the same function in R and Python. This package aims to provide a common syntax for the most common functions in the tidyverse into pandas.

These functions include:

- `mutate()`
- `filter()`
- `select()`
- `arrange()`
